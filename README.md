# Simple-Habit-Tracker
This is a simple habit tracker to allow you to improve habits you choose.
My name is Emanuel Portugal and I am a senior at KSU and I decidede to choose a topic that can help us all in improving something we want to work on.
https://github.com/ksu-is/Simple-Habit-Tracker for Sprint 1 task


ON 7/15/25 started working on simple habit code by watching tutorials on commands to make the code functional.


ON 7/15/25 8:10PM I fixed lines 12-18 due to syntax error. Correct adjustments made 


ON 7/15/25 8:56 I added comments to make the code easier to read for others to analyze.

ON 7/19/25 8:26 I added the code for it be available to operate in Visual Studio Code.
